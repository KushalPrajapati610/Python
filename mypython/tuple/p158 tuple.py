#15. Write a Python program to multiply all elements in a tuple by 2.

# Hint: Use a list comprehension or a loop to iterate through the tuple and multiply each element, then convert it back to a tuple.

# Sample data:
# t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
# Expected Output: (2, 4, 6, 8)

t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
for i in t1:
    print(i * 2)
