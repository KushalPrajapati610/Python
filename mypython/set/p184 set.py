#15. Write a Python program to find the difference between two sets.

# Hint: Use the difference() method or - operator to get elements that are in one set but not the other.
# Sample data:
# s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
# s2 = {33, 44}
# Expected Output: {11, 22, 55}

s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
s2 = {33, 44}
print(s1 - s2)
