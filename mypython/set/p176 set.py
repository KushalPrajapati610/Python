#7. Write a Python program to create a set difference.

# Hint: Use the difference() method or - operator to find elements in one set that are not in another.

# Sample data:

# s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
# s2 = {11, 22, 99, 66, 55}
# Expected Output: {33, 44}


s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
s2 = {11, 22, 99, 66, 55}
print(s1 - s2)
