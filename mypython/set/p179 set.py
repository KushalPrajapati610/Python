#10. Write a Python program to find the maximum and minimum values in a set.
# Hint: Use Python's max() and min() functions to find the largest and smallest values.
# Sample data:
# s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
# Expected Output:
# Max value is 55
# Min value is 11

s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
print(max(s1))
print(min(s1))
