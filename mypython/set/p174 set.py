#5. Write a Python program to create an intersection of sets.

# Hint: Use the intersection() method or & operator to find common elements between two sets.
# Sample data:
# s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
# s2 = {11, 22, 99, 66, 55}
# Expected Output: {11, 22, 55}

s1 = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55}
s2 = {11, 22, 99, 66, 55}
print(s1.intersection(s2))
