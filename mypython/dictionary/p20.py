#18. You and your wife argued about expenses last night.
# You both want to know who is spending more in a month.
# Now you both go to the Little Yoda he is a good python programmer.
# He suggested that both of you add an entry in a dictionary next time you spend money.
# So that you can have a clear picture of your expenses and plan to reduce them.
# Both dictionaries are as below-

# Your expenses -
# Clothes - 1100
# Shoes - 1000
# Watch - 900
# Mobile Recharge - 699
# Petrol - 1980

# Your Wifeâ€™s expenses -
# Mobile Recharge - 799
# DTH recharge - 999
# Clothes - 2310
# Makeup - 3670
# Shoes - 999
