#Write a Python program to append one list to another list.
#Sample List 1: [11, 44, 500, 22, 99]
#Sample List 2: [77, 200, 66, 2, 11, 22]
#Expected Result: [11, 44, 500, 22, 99, 77, 200, 66, 2, 11, 22]
#Hint: Use the extend() method or + operator to combine the two lists.

list1 = [11, 44, 500, 22, 99]
list2 = [77, 200, 66, 2, 11, 22]
list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)
